# Privacy Policy (Workout Tracker)

Workout Tracker is designed to be privacy-friendly and work without an account.

## Data storage

- Workout data is stored locally on your device using SwiftData.

## Data collection

- No account is required to use core features.
- The app does not intentionally track you across apps/websites by default.

## Backups / export

- If you export a backup file, you control where it goes (Files, iCloud Drive, email, etc.).
- Treat exports as sensitive: workout history can be personal.

## Changes to this policy

If you add analytics, crash reporting, ads, cloud sync, or any other network features:
- Update this policy, and
- Update App Store privacy disclosures accordingly.

## Contact

- Recommended: use GitHub Issues for support, or add a support email once published.
