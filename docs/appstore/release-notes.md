## Long description

Workout Tracker is a lightweight workout logging app built for speed and simplicity.

**Log workouts fast**
- Track sets (weight + reps), mark sets complete, keep momentum.

**Routines & templates**
- Build routines you can reuse to start sessions quickly.

**History that’s actually useful**
- Browse past sessions, compare two sessions, and review per-exercise performance over time.

**Personal records**
- Track PRs and see progress without noise.

**Privacy-first**
- Your workout data stays on-device by default. No account required.

## Keywords (keep it honest and non-spammy)

workout tracker, gym log, strength training, workout log, fitness journal, weight lifting, training log, routine planner, personal records, sets reps, fitness tracker, on-device

Tip: Apple’s keyword field has a character limit and prefers comma-separated terms. Avoid repeating the app name over and over.

## Privacy-friendly blurb (matches the repo privacy stance)

Workout Tracker stores your workout data locally on your device. No account is required to use core features, and the app does not intentionally track you across apps/websites by default. If you export a backup, you control where it goes (Files/iCloud Drive/etc.). See `PRIVACY.md` for details.
